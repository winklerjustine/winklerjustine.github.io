# About  me
Hi there, nice to meet you! I am Justine, a first-year PhD candidate in the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) at the Institute of Logic, Language and Computation ([ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/)).
My research focus is visually grounded language. Currently, I am working on improving multimodal (image and text) transformers' word understanding. 
My supervisors are [Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Sandro Pezzelle](https://sandropezzelle.github.io/). 

My academic journey started with a B.Sc. in Cognitive Science at the [University of Osnabrück](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/startseite/). Through this transdisciplinary background, 
I learned how to approach language-related research questions from the perspectives of different research areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics,  Computing Science, or Neuroscience.
Next, I expanded my understanding of how to evaluate and actively improve language processing algorithms with a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/). 
As a personal challenge, I pursued the M.Sc. in Computing Science (Data Science specialization) at the same time.

Friends and teammates often describe me as very enthusiastic and cheerful. I am open and sociable, loving to learn new languages to communicate with you in your mother tongue.
